          I can develop and design the user interface of websites.This includes
          creating and implementing layouts, styles, and graphics using HTML,
          CSS, and JavaScript. I can also work on making sure that the website
          or application is responsive and accessible to different devices and
          users. Additionally, I will work on improving the user experience and
          interactivity of the website or application by using libraries and
          frameworks such as jQuery, React, or Angular.
